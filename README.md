# Ray tracing engine

This is a side project for a `ray-tracing` engine.

I have a love for physics, and visual graphics are just so satisfying to program.

This is a project for me to do and share what I love. I hope you find it interesting and useful!

I am also thoroughly documenting everything thoroughly, so that both you and I can learn along the way.

Hope you enjoy this almost as much as I do!


# TODO

## Functionality:

1. Camera
2. Shooting rays
3. Background
4. Color sphere
5. Floor
6. Anti aliasing (shoot multiple random rays)
7. Diffuse reflection
8. Metallic reflection
9. Refraction


## Quality improvements

1. Shift logic from header `.h` files to `.cpp` files
2. Write `unit` tests
3. Create an `Orientation` for the camera
