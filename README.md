# Ray tracing engine

This is a side project for a `ray-tracing` engine.

I have a love for physics, and visual graphics are just so satisfying to program.

This is a project for me to do and share what I love. I hope you find it interesting and useful!

I am also thoroughly documenting everything thoroughly, so that both you and I can learn along the way.

Hope you enjoy this almost as much as I do!
